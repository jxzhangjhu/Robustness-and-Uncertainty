## Confidence score application

1. classifer, e.g., tabular, image
2. NLP

Google cloud, AWS, Azure show confidence score in your products!! 

## Confidence score concepts from website, blog 

1. What is confidence score in classification?

A confidence score enables you to quantify the challenge in decision making for each input, to diagnose when the predictor becomes less effective because of data distribution shifts, or to determine when to route the prediction to human experts because the test sample is an outlier.

2. Confidence score related to ML metrics, precision, recall, how to set up the shreshold of confidence

## Confidence score in papers

1. most confidence scores are defined by calibration score, e.g., ECE.

2. There is no overview paper or clear definitation in this area, so it is a good opportunity to have a solid paper to do that, including 
- ML classification
- DL classification
- NLP applications 


3. No relted github! 

4. Confidence is one type of ways to express uncertinty 
- confidence score vlue
- confidence interval 
- confidence set 
- confidence decision 


5. Confidence shows many potential applications 
- GNN
- adversarial robustness 
- RL 
- Domain adaption
